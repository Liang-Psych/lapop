## Abstract
This study aims to explore whether and how Chinese development finance activities in Brazil influence local public attitudes toward China in the context of China's growing global economic influence. By integrating survey data from the **AmericasBarometer (2012-2023)** with geocoded project data from **AidData’s Global Chinese Development Finance Geospatial Dataset**, this research constructs a comprehensive dataset of **4,318 Brazilian respondents across 499 cities**. It also combines this dataset with case studies of the **Belo Monte Ultra-High-Voltage Transmission Line project** and the **China-Brazil Science and Technology Courtyard project**, adopting a mixed-methods approach that systematically analyzes the impact of Chinese development finance on Brazilian public attitudes toward China.

The findings indicate a significant positive correlation between Chinese development finance projects and local Brazilian attitudes toward China, suggesting that Chinese development finance can generate positive soft power returns. Heterogeneity analyses further reveal the conditional nature of this influence: Chinese development finance projects have a stronger positive effect on attitudes in less developed cities, and individuals who frequently engage with news media exhibit more positive responses to Chinese projects. The case studies further illuminate specific mechanisms by which Chinese projects influence local attitudes, namely by providing direct material benefits, creating employment opportunities, and strengthening key infrastructure.

The research also finds that the effectiveness of Chinese development finance is moderated by various factors, including local development levels, media exposure, and project implementation approaches. The Belo Monte project has gained significant positive evaluations in underdeveloped areas by addressing critical electricity supply issues, creating employment, and facilitating technology transfer. The China-Brazil Science and Technology Courtyard project, meanwhile, has successfully built deep interpersonal connections and shared value recognition with local communities in rural areas through a “parallel experience sharing” model.

This study advances the understanding of the relationship between development finance activities and soft power, emphasizing the conditional nature of the transformation of development finance into soft power assets. The findings provide insights for China’s international development cooperation and public diplomacy strategies: to align closely with urgent local development needs, strengthen project visibility, enhance local integration, and build diversified project portfolios.
